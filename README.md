# About This Repository
This repository contains resources for creating a new [People and Skills Specification](https://www.internetofproduction.org/people-and-skills) in support of developing a Mutual Recognition and Data specification for use in a maker passport. The People and Skills Specification, generally, will provide a framework for the development of maker passports in systems, consortia, and collaborative making, fabrication, and open manufacturing ecosystems.

The central goal of developing a People and Skills Specifciation is to create a shared understanding of the explicit, implicit, tacit, and procedural knowledge necessary for individual makers to participate in and easily navigate a distributed manufacturing ecosystem; this navigation will be enabled by using a digital ‘maker passport,’ the criteria for which will be defined by maker community members.

An immediate use case for this work is application to the open system infrastructure developed as part of the pan-African [mAKe project](https://makeafricaeu.org/). Participating makers who are issued a digital ‘Maker Passport’ will have a way to communicate experience and skill levels automatically for ease of navigation through the ecosystem (estimate of 500+ instances) of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs).
